Paris
The day after Christmas, 1908
You must know, dear Mr. Kappus, how glad I was to have the lovely letter
from you. The news that you give me, real and expressible as it now is again,
seems to me good news, and the longer I thought it over, the more I felt that it
was very good news indeed. That is really what I wanted to write you for Christmas
Eve; but I have been variously and uninterruptedly living in my work this
winter, and the ancient holiday arrived so quickly that I hardly had enough time
to do the most necessary errands, much less to write.
But I have thought of you often during this holiday and imagined how silent
you must be in your solitary fort amongst the empty hills, upon which those large
southern winds fling themselves as if they wanted to devour them in large pieces.
It must be immense, this silence, in which sounds and movements have room,
and if one thinks that along with all this the presence of the distant sea also
resounds, perhaps as the innermost note in this prehistoric harmony, then one
can only wish that you are trustingly and patiently letting the magnificent
solitude work upon you, this solitude which can no longer be erased from your
life; which, in everything that is in store for you to experience and to do, will act
as an anonymous influence, continuously and gently decisive, rather as the blood
of our ancestors incessantly moves in us and combines with our own to form the
unique, unrepeatable being that we are at every turning of our life.
Yes: I am glad you have that firm, sayable existence with you, that title, that
uniform, that service, all that tangible and limited world, which in such surroundings,
with such an isolated and not numerous body of men, takes on
seriousness and necessity, and implies a vigilant application, above and beyond
the frivolity and mere timepassing of the military profession, and not only
permits a self-reliant attentiveness but actually cultivates it. And to be in circumstances
that are working upon us, that from time to time place us in front of great

natural Things — that is all we need.
Art too is just a way of living, and however one lives, one can, without
knowing, prepare for it; in everything real one is closer to it, more its neighbor,
than in the unreal half-artistic professions, which, while they pretend to be close
to art, in practice deny and attack the existence of all art — as, for example, all of
journalism does and almost all criticism and three quarters of what is called (and
wants to be called) literature. I am glad, in a word, that you have overcome the
danger of landing in one of those professions, and are solitary and courageous,
somewhere in a rugged reality. May the coming year support and strengthen you
in that.
Always Yours,
R. M. Rilke
